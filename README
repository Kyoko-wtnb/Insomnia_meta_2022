Thie repository include R script (gene_prioritization.R) to perform gene prioritization approach proposed in the publication (Watanabe et al. Nat. Genet. 2022) and example input and output files for insomnia meta-analysis under ISM folder.

You can apply this R script to perform gene prioritization for any other GWAS.
To do so, the script expect several input files. Please follow the below steps to prepare input files.

data folder contains other data used in gene_prioritization.R

Step 1. run FUMA on full GWAS summary statistics
Parameters are as specified in ISM/gwas/params.config
Change reference panel accordingly.
Download results from FUMA and locate ISM/gwas/.
The folder only include files necessary to perform gene prioritization, not full results you can download from FUMA.
Some of the large files are compressed (annov.txt.gz, annot.txt.gz and eqtl.txt.gz).
Although the parameter include CI mapping, it's not used in this prioritization approach and related files are not included in this example.

Step 2. run FINEMAP
Use FINEMAP with LDstore to perform statistical file mapping for loci identified in step 1.
For each locus, take SNPs within 50kb from the top SNP.
The followings are example commands to perform FINEMAP.

### create LD matrix
plink --bfile $reference_panel_pfile --extract locus_$i.snps \
	--memory 50000 \
	--make-bed --out locus_$i
ldstore --bplink locus_$i --n-threads 1 \
	--bcor locus_$i.bcor
ldstore --bcor locus_$i.bcor_1 \
	--matrix $locus_$i.ld

### run FINEMAP
finemap_v1.3.1_x86_64 --sss --group-snps \
    --in-files master.txt \
    --n-causal-snps 10 \
    --dataset $i

Please follow http://www.christianbenner.com/index_v1.1.html#input to create master.txt file for your GWAS.

Following steps require a file cred_snps.txt.gz with the following format and locate under ISM/finemap folder.

locus	uniqID	chr	pos	A1	A2	maf	prob	log10bf
1	1:4714995:A_G	1	4714995	G	A	0.34425	0.348147	2.4308
1	1:4723917:A_G	1	4723917	G	A	0.33989	0.129744	1.87663
1	1:4724231:C_G	1	4724231	C	G	0.33973	0.118083	1.82995


Step 3. run eQTL colocalization
Use coloc library on R to perform colocalization of the GWAS of the phenotype of interest and eQTLs.
For each locus, take SNPs within the locus boundary defined in the step 1 FUMA with 10kb extended both side.
The following is an example R script.

### prepare dataset
### assuimg there are two data frame eqtl (with eQTL summary statistics), snps (with GWAS summary statistics and MAF).
ds1 <- list(type="cc", snp=eqtl$uniqID, pvalues=snps$p[match(eqtl$uniqID, snps$uniqID)], N=snps$N[match(eqtl$uniqID, snps$uniqID)])
ds2 = list(type="quant", snp=eqtl$uniqID, pvalues=eqtl$p, N=eqtl$N)
prob_h4 <- as.numeric(coloc.abf(dataset1=ds1, dataset2=ds2, MAF=snps$MAF[match(eqtl$uniqID,     snps$uniqID)])$summary[6])

Following steps require a file coloc_eqtls.txt with the following format and locate under ISM/coloc folder.

ds	gene	nSNPs	pp.h4
PsychENCODE_eQTLs	ENSG00000116771	139	0.000532006766331862
PsychENCODE_eQTLs	ENSG00000116786	115	0.980123952032653
PsychENCODE_eQTLs	ENSG00000132906	136	1.18336293612532e-05

4. run FUMA on credible SNPs from step 2
Same for step 1 but use the GWAS summary statistics filtered on credible SNPs identified in step 2.
Since FUMA web application does not allow to specify second P-value threshold higher than 1e-5 but you would want to annotate all credible SNPs, you can assign fake P-value 9.9e-6 in the P-value columns if SNPs have p>=1e-5.
You can already filter credible SNPs by PIP (prob columns). In the paper, PIP>0.1 was used.
But this filtering is performed in the step 5 as well. In case you want to play around with PIP threshold for gene mapping, you can annotate all credible SNPs here and filter in the step 5.
Download the results from FUMA and locate ISM/cred/.
Required files are the same as step 1, and compress large text files.

5. Gene mapping
Defining HC genes, HC-1 and HC-m genes, and filtering by PPI are all done in gene_prioritization.R
The script does not accept argument, please change variables as needed.
